                4th Grade Math Practice Problems. Written in python, this code generates a random question from one of two different problem types and presents it to the user to solve. Problem types were selected after reviewing Oregon's 4th grade curriculum guide. Tyler Langdale was the other primary contributer. This was the final project for ENGR 102, taken Fall of 2024 at Oregon State University. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hc5r6R4VLbll7WXhY1mWUlTxzu1z_Ljr/view?usp=sharing">4th Grade Math Practice</a>
